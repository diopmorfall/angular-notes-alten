<h2>Hello World: ngIf!</h2>

<button type="button" (click)="onEditClick()">Make text editable!</button>

<!--
    A directive (like *ngFor) that allows to dynamically change the dom structure; I can handle its behavior in the other file, this way I can separate the presentation and the logic
-->
<div *ngIf="canEdit; else noEdit">
  <p>You can edit the following paragraph.</p>
</div>

<ng-template #noEdit>
  <p>The following paragraph is read only. Try clicking the button!</p>
